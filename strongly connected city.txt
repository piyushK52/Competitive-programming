If outer streets (top, bottom, rightmost and leftmost) form a cycle (clockwise or counter-clockwise), then
by following that cycle, one can reach any junction on that cycle from any other junction on the same cycle.
moreover, independent of the directions of inner streets you can also reach all "inner" junctions from any "outer" 
junction. Therefore, if the outer streets form a cycle, then the answer is "YES".
If outer streets do not form a cycle, then
there is at least one "corner" junction, for which both horizontal and vertical streets have directions towards 
that junction (otherwise, there it would be a cycle). Since one can not move out from such "corner" junction to 
anywhere else, the answer is "NO".
